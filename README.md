# 👋 Hi, I'm Derek Stento

I’m a backend-focused Python developer who enjoys building practical, data-driven applications. For my main portfolio project, I created **Sprout**, a fully deployed finance tracker built with Flask, PostgreSQL, raw SQL queries, and a vanilla JS frontend. I chose this project because managing finances has always come naturally to me, and I wanted to turn that real-life skill into a working product.

## 💡 Why I’m Pursuing Software Development

I got into programming because I wanted a career that challenges me, pushes me to grow, and connects directly to real-world problem-solving. I learn best by building, which is why hands-on projects like Sprout have been central to my progress.

I’m especially drawn to backend engineering because I’m a numbers-driven thinker who enjoys working with data, structure, and logic. When I run into difficult concepts, I don’t quit—I keep working until the idea finally clicks. That discipline has been a big part of my self-taught journey.
